Restaurant-Generator


### Overview

_**Restaurant-Generator** is an application that helps users choose which restaurants to eat at. Users answer questions ranging from food category, price, location, ratings, and specialty requests. Using the Yelp API, the application returns suggestions on where to eat, seamlessly making the decision for the user. The questions will be asked one by one in a ‘conversational design’ where users select from 3-4 options to keep answer the age old question ‘Where do you want to eat?’._
